Project Goal: Creating a social media based app to satisfy the theme of helping with the transitioning from work to the home. The application has the user post thoughts like a discussion post. We are aware this is similar to Yik Yak, but we want to put in more new features and ideas to show how this can help out with the WFH transition for people who need someone to talk to in a local radius.


What We Accomplished:
- Deleting post
- Uploading posts
- No photographs function of course
- Post disappears after 10 seconds (for demonstration purposes -- else it would be 24 hours)
- Imported a sign in registration and authentication idea.
- Used Google Maps API and HTML Geolocation API to try to work with user location data: 
      users outside of NYC cannot access or post on the main general homepage.
- Used another database to store posts posted on the homepage and the college chatrooms.



What to do next for the future:

- Try to import word filters to avoid cyber bullying.
- Make the user only be able to access other threads posted within their 5 mile radius.
- Set up a personal profile for users
- Add a specific server for CTP students as well to encourage commodity with a sense of a camaraderie.
